## 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

This project uses environment variables to keep the API key secure.

### 1️⃣ Create a `.env` file

In the project root directory, create a file named `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

⚠️ **Do NOT upload `.env` to GitHub**. It is already ignored using `.gitignore`.

### 2️⃣ `.env.example`

A `.env.example` file is provided to show the required environment variables. Rename it to `.env` and add your actual API key.
